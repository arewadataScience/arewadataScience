This work is deeply interdisciplinary and draws insights and tools from various areas of social science, computer science, statistics, and medicine.\nHe completed his doctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Cohn (nonverbal behavior, machine learning, depression) and Dr. Aidan Wright (interpersonal functioning, statistics, personality). He then completed his predoctoral clinical internship at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (inpatient psychiatry, trauma treatment, neuropsychology) and a two-year postdoctoral research fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University under the mentorship of Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (verbal behavior, machine learning, computer science).\nHe is now an Assistant Professor in the department of Psychology at the University of Kansas, where he directs the Affective Communication and Computing lab and the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) program. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on psychological assessment, data science, and statistics within the department and offers several summer “bootcamp” courses for graduate students and faculty (on data science and machine learning) through Pitt Methods.
